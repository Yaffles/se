Software needs to account for the varying levels of security awareness among its users and mitigate risks associated with less security-conscious users. Commonly, this includes providing secure defaults (e.g. requiring multi-factor authentication by default), restricting unnecessary user permissions and displaying clear security prompts. Software designers often need to balance security enhancements with user experience, ensuring that security measures are as seamless as possible to encourage compliance and reduce the likelihood of users bypassing security for convenience.</li><li><b>Accessibility requirements:</b> End users may have different accessibility requirements, influencing how security features are implemented. For instance, software design must ensure that security measures (e.g. multi-factor authentication) are accessible to users with disabilities, ensuring that security does not come at the cost of usability.</li></ol></div>"

It leverages HTML/JavaScript templates (some are pre-made but configurable, others can be written by designers) that contain placeholders, including variables, loops iterating over collections and conditionals. Different template engines (e.g. EJS, Pug, Handlebars, etc.) use different notations (syntaxes) to describe their templates and placeholders. When the web application is running, the template engine on the web server replaces the variables/placeholders in the used template file with actual values, then sends this dynamically customised HTML web page content to the client (which never sees the used templates). Templates also enable fast rendering of server-side data that needs to be passed to the application. By using a template engine, developers can separate HTML presentation structure from the application logic, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

From these 7, our Software Engineering syllabus emphasises only #1, #3 and #7 so their application on the given ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app scenario is discussed here.</p><p><b>Proactive not reactive approach</b> is about anticipating risks and preventing privacy-invasive events before they occur. In the ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app scenario, the personal and medical information (possibly also some of the demographic information) is personally identifiable information (PII) that must be kept private and protected. It can be anticipated that this sensitive information could be compromised on the client side, transport over the Internet or the server side. Therefore, all information provided by a user should be protected (e.g. encrypted) in transport over the Internet and any client-side and server-side handling, including storage. This is protection in transit, in use and rest.</p><p><b>Embed privacy into design</b> is about ensuring that privacy becomes one of the core functions of any system or service. In the ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app scenario, this means the app's design must include the decisions to protect all user's information in transport/storage/handling, not storing any user information (neither on the server nor on the client) after a user is shown the probability of melanoma in the given images, and not providing any user information to any 3rd party.</p><p><b>Respect for user privacy</b> is about keeping the interest of individuals paramount for any system or service, e.g. by offering strong privacy defaults and user-friendly options, as well as ensuring appropriate notices are given. In the ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app scenario, the default protection of all user information in transit/rest/use, the default server-side and client-side secure deletion/destruction of all user information, and the default of not providing of any user information to any 3rd party are strong with respect to user privacy.</p></div>"

In the ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app scenario, this would mean that some team members systematically review code written by other team members and provide improvement feedback. Code review encourages knowledge sharing, catches vulnerabilities and bugs early in the development cycle, reduces the cost of remediation, and enhances both code quality and security. Its limitations include: can be time-consuming and may not identify all runtime vulnerabilities.</p><p><b>Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</b> is a white-box testing method that analyses source code for security vulnerabilities without executing the program. In the ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app scenario, some team members would use SAST tools to perform SAST on the app's code without executing it. SAST can identify vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection, buffer overflows, insecure APIs) early in the development process. Its limitations include producing false positives and not detecting runtime-specific vulnerabilities.</p><p><b>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</b> is a black-box testing method that runs software and analyses its behaviour (e.g. when exposed to simulated attacks) to find vulnerabilities that are only apparent during runtime. In the scenario, team members would use DAST tools to test the running app with simulated attacks. DAST identifies real-world runtime vulnerabilities and can find issues related to configuration and runtime environments. Its limitations include occurring later in the development cycle and being more time-consuming than SAST.</p><p><b>Vulnerability assessment</b> is a systematic process of identifying, quantifying, classifying and prioritizing security vulnerabilities in an application. In the ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app scenario, team members would use appropriate tools to systematically scan for, identify and prioritise security vulnerabilities in the app. It provides a comprehensive overview of vulnerabilities and helps prioritise remediation efforts. Its limitations include not identifying all vulnerabilities and becoming outdated quickly if not performed regularly.</p><p><b>Penetration testing</b> is performing simulated real-world attacks on a system to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited. In the scenario, external hired white-hat hackers would perform simulated attacks on the running app. It provides a realistic real-world assessment of the security posture and identifies vulnerabilities that may not be detected by other methods. Its limitations include being time-consuming, resource-intensive and expensive, and it is a point-in-time assessment.</p><p>Incorporating a combination of these strategies provides a robust approach to managing code security. By integrating these methods into the software development lifecycle, the ‘nAIs Skin Check PWA' app team can significantly enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited.</p></div>"
